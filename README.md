# NomMetric
A Flutter-based mess tracking app designed for college use, enabling students to track meals across multiple messes, developed for OpenCode’25.

## Project Overview

NomMetric is a Flutter-based mess tracking application designed to simplify and digitize meal management in our college hostels.
In many colleges, mess attendance, meal tracking, and rebate calculations are handled manually, leading to inaccuracies, lack of transparency, and poor user experience.

NomMetric aims to provide a unified, scalable solution where students can track their meals across multiple messes, while enabling accurate attendance logging and data-driven decision-making.

The application is built using Flutter for cross-platform support and Firebase (Firestore) as the backend, ensuring real-time updates, reliability, and ease of scalability.
In addition to being a practical utility, NomMetric is developed as a learning-focused open-source project, allowing contributors to gain hands-on experience with Flutter, Firebase, and real-world application architecture.
### Core Features

#### 1. Meal & Attendance Tracking
- Track student attendance for each meal (breakfast, lunch, dinner)
- Support for multiple messes within the same campus
- Accurate daily and monthly attendance records
- Reduced ambiguity compared to manual attendance systems

#### 2. Rebate Calculation System
- Automatic calculation of mess rebates based on missed meals
- Monthly rebate summaries for students
- Configurable rebate rules to match different colleges
- Transparent rebate history to avoid disputes

#### 3. Menu Management
- Digital mess menu visible to students
- Support for daily and weekly menus
- Easy updates to menu items without app redeployment
- Support for special meals and holiday menus

#### 4. Data Persistence & Real-time Sync
- Firestore-backed real-time data updates
- Consistent data across devices and sessions
- Offline-friendly architecture with automatic sync when online

#### 5. Clean & Modular UI
- Simple, intuitive interface designed for daily use
- Modular widget structure for easy feature expansion
- Responsive layouts for different screen sizes

NomMetric is intended to be both a **practical campus utility** and a **learning-focused open-source project**, making it suitable for experimentation, feature expansion, and architectural improvements.
